## Build and run

Make sure you have installed the following tools:

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

Also you will need to have [configured a `GOPATH`](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) with `${GOPATH}/bin` added to your `PATH`.

Open a new shell so the `GOPATH` you have configured earlier is correctly loaded in the environment variables. Then run the following:

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/VNG-Realisatie
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/VNG-Realisatie
git clone git@github.com:VNG-Realisatie/nlx.git
cd nlx
docker-compose up
```
