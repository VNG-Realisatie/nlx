The current goal of this project is to deliver a Proof of Concept for the [NLX Product Vision](./docs/product-vision.md).

## Build and run

Make sure you have [installed Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [configured a `GOPATH`](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) with `${GOPATH}/bin` added to your `PATH`.

To build and run all [components](./docs/repository-structure.md), execute the following in a shell.

```bash
go get github.com/cortesi/modd/cmd/modd
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/VNG-Realisatie
git clone git@github.com:VNG-Realisatie/nlx.git
cd nlx
modd
```

[`modd`](https://github.com/cortesi/modd) will watch for changes in the source code and builds/runs the components. For details see [`modd.conf`](./modd.conf).

Alternatively to `modd`, you could use the [`go` tool](https://golang.org/cmd/go/) to build components and run manually.
