# European Interoperability Framework (EIF)

The European interoperability framework is a commonly
agreed approach to the delivery of European public
services in an interoperable manner. It defines basic
interoperability guidelines in the form of common
principles, models and recommendations.

The purpose of the EIF is to:

- inspire European public administrations in their efforts 
  to design and deliver seamless European public services to other public
  administrations, citizens and businesses which are to the degree possible,
  digital-by-default (i.e. providing services and data preferably via digital
  channels), cross-border-by-default (i.e. accessible for all citizens in the
  EU) and open-by-default (i.e. enabling reuse, participation/access and
  transparency);
- provide guidance to public administrations on the design and update 
  of national interoperability frameworks (NIFs), or national policies,
  strategies and guidelines promoting interoperability;
- contribute to the establishment of the digital single market by fostering 
  cross-border and cross- sectoral interoperability for the delivery of 
  European public services.

The EIF is meant to be a generic framework applicable to all public
administrations in the EU. It lays out the basic conditions for achieving
interoperability, acting as the common denominator for relevant initiatives at
all levels including European, national, regional and local, embracing public
administrations, citizens and businesses.

The EIF describes a set of 47 recommendations, as actionable items to be
implemented by public administrations. Several these recommendations impact
NLX. All recommendations from the EIF and their impact on NLX are detailed
