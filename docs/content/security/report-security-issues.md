## Security issues

Although VNG Realisatie tries to avoid security issues to the best of ability, it is always possible that a vulnerability is overlooked.

You may come across a security issue in the NLX System. Be it your own research or hearsay, in any case, there might be doubt about how risky it is to communicate about what you learned with our organisation due to the nature of your findings. With our Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy we hope to take away some doubts.


## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

With this Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy, [VNG Realisatie](https://vngrealisatie.nl) aims to become informed about security issues as quickly as possible without putting the one reporting it at risk. This policy details the conditions for a responsible, coordinated way for reporting and publishing about security issues.


### Scope

This policy does apply on the NLX project.
Involved public URLs:
* https://nlx.io  (including all sub-domains)
* https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx  (Open Source code repository)
* https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx-infra (Open Source infrastructure configuration)

The NLX System consists of a grid of applications in multiple organisations. When you report a security issue that is specific for the implementation in an organisation other than VNG Realisatie, we will pass on all information and inform you accordingly. Interactions between reporter (you) and third party organisations are out of scope for this policy.


### What we ask from the reporter:

* Report findings via one of the following methods (listed in order of our preference):
  * Send an PGP encrypted e-mail to `security@nlx.io`, using the [PGP instructions](#using-pgp)
  * Send an unencrypted e-mail to `security@nlx.io`
  * Use the Gitlab [issue form](https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/issues/new) of the NLX project and mark it confidential by using the checkbox below the main input field.
* Provide enough information for our security specialists to understand and reproduce the issue in order to solve the problem as quickly as possible. Be specific.
* Provide contact details so our team can contact you and work with you to solve the problem.
* Report your findings as quickly as possible.
* Do not share any information about the security issue with others until the problem has been solved.
* Act responsibly with your knowledge about the security problem. Do not perform actions on our systems beyond what is strictly necessary to demonstrate  the security issue.

_Avoid the following actions in any case:_

* Usage of malware
* Altering, removing or copying data (if you want to proof access, use screenshots)
* Altering the system in any way
* Repeatingly accessing a system beyond what is reasonably necessary to demonstrate the security issue
* Sharing knowledge about the security issue with others, or allowing others to access the system using the security issue
* Usage of brute force techniques
* Usage of Denial of service (DoS) of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
* Usage of social engineering
* Attempts to gain physical access to our systems
