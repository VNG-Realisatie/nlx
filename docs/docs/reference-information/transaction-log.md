## Introduction

The Inway and the Outway are able to log metadata of the requests they process. This data is stored in the transaction log database. The transaction log is disabled by default. If you want to learn how to setup the transaction log you can review our documentation for [Helm](../try-nlx/helm/transaction-log) or [Docker](../try-nlx/docker/introduction.md)
