## Introduction

To provide an API to the NLX network, you need to route traffic through the **inway**.
To make sure traffic is encrypted between your and other nodes, we will use the certificate which we've setup in [Retrieve a demo certificate ](./retrieve-a-demo-certificate).

Please note that:

* You need a domain name to provide an inway (an IP address will not work).
* The domain should be the same as the domain you used to generate the certificates (that was in [Retrieve a demo certificate](./retrieve-a-demo-certificate)).

It is not recommended to follow this guide when you're working from your home network.

> In the Docker Compose file we have started, the inway is running on
`8443`. Make sure that port is publicly available.

## Verification

Assuming you followed [Getting up and running](./getting-up-and-running), the inway and Management API should already be up and running.

You can confirm that by inspecting the Management API logs:

```
docker logs nlx-try-me-management-api
```

The output should look similar to:

```
{"level":"INFO","time":"2021-01-06T14:06:01.051Z","caller":"nlx-management-api/main.go:61","message":"version info","version":"v0.92.0","source-hash":"5d5a8afecb1e504d6ea5c865d839720d47fedb24"}
```

Next, let's take a look at the logs of our inway:

```
docker logs nlx-try-me-inway
```

The output should look similar to:

```
{"level":"INFO","time":"2021-01-06T14:12:23.905Z","caller":"nlx-inway/main.go:156","message":"version info","version":"v0.92.0","source-hash":"5d5a8afecb1e504d6ea5c865d839720d47fedb24"}
```


## Create a service

In the following example we will use [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io) as an example API.

To provide our API in the NLX network we have to create a service in the Management UI.
You can do that by going to the services page where you click on the 'Add service' button.

For the service name, use `SwaggerPetStore` and for the API endpoint URL use `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2`.
Select `Inway-01` as the inway to be used by this service. The remaining fields can
be left blank.

Whenever you're ready, click 'Service toevoegen' to save the details and register the service in the demo directory.

> If you're specifying you own API, please note that `localhost` will not work. If your API is running on the same machine as
your inway, the endpoint URL should be your network IP and not `localhost`.

After adding the service, you should see the service in the services page and in the directory.

> The directory will remove stale services automatically. A service will be marked stale when it is not announced for more than 24 hours.


## Querying your own APIs

Now let's try to fetch some data from our inway using our outway using `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/{{ my-certificate-subject-serial-number }}/SwaggerPetStore/v2/pet/20002085
```

The response of the `curl` command should look similar to the following output (where `ORGANIZATION_NAME`/`PUBLIC_KEY_FINGERPRINT` are derived from the certificate generated in [step 3](./retrieve-a-demo-certificate)).

```
nlx-inway: permission denied, organization "ORGANIZATION_NAME" or public key "PUBLIC_KEY_FINGERPRINT" is not allowed access.
```

We are denied access because we first need to request access. This is one of the key features of NLX Management!

In order to request access, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the 'Directory' in NLX Management.
1. Select the service `SwaggerPetstore` from the list and click on 'Toegang aanvragen'.
1. Now navigate to the 'Services' page and again select the service `SwaggerPetStore`.
1. You should see one access request under the section 'Toegansverzoeken'.
1. Expand the section and click on 'Accepteren' to accept the access request.
1. You now have an access grant for the service.

Let's try to fetch the data again.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/my-organization/SwaggerPetStore/v2/pet/20002085
```

The response of the `curl` command should look similar to the following output.

```json
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "x-forwarded-proto": "https",
    "host": "petstore.swagger.io",
    "accept": "*/*",
    "accept-encoding": "gzip",
    "user-agent": "curl/7.54.0",
    "x-nlx-logrecord-id": "<arbitrary-logrecord-id>",
    "x-nlx-request-organization": "00000000000000000001",
    "x-forwarded-port": "443"
  },
  "url": "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/20002085"
}
```


Congratulations, you have successfully provided an API on the NLX network! ðŸŽ‰

## In sum

You have provided your API to the NLX network. In this part, you have:

- Created a service for the demo API
- Used your outway to consume your own inway API.
