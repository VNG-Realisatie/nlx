### Docker

You can download Docker for Linux and Mac OS [here](https://hub.docker.com?overlay=onboarding). Please note that you will have to create a free DockerHub account before you can download Docker.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="windows">

We currently support Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 15063 or later).

### Powershell

In order to successfully execute all commands in this guide make sure you are using `PowerShell` in administrator mode and not the `Command prompt`. To launch `PowerShell` in administrator mode, type `PowerShell` in the searchfield of the taskbar, you should find `Windows PowerShell`, right click on it and select `Run as Administrator`.

### Docker

You can download Docker for Windows [here](https://hub.docker.com?overlay=onboarding). Please note that you will have to create a free DockerHub account before you can download Docker. Docker requires hyper-V to be enabled and Docker will ask you to enable it on start-up if this does not happen you can enable it yourself by running following command in PowerShell.

```bash
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
```

## Docker Compose

For setting up the testing environment locally we'll use Docker Compose.
You can install it by following the [installation steps of the official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose).

## Cloning NLX-Try-me repository

First, let's clone the NLX project. It contains the Docker Compose file and its dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx-try-me.git
```

After the repository is cloned, move into it:

```bash
cd nlx-try-me
```

## In sum

Having prepared your environment will allow you to quickly move on during the next 
chapters. Now let's [retrieve a demo certificate](./retrieve-a-demo-certificate) 
so you are able to send traffic through the NLX network.
