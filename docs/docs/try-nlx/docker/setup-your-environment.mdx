<TabItem value="windows">

We currently support Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 15063 or later).

## Powershell

In order to successfully execute all commands in this guide make sure you are using `PowerShell` in administrator mode and not the `Command prompt`. To launch `PowerShell` in administrator mode, type `PowerShell` in the searchfield of the taskbar, you should find `Windows PowerShell`, right click on it and select `Run as Administrator`.

## Docker Desktop

You can download Docker Desktop for Windows [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/). We advise users to use the WSL 2 backend when working with Docker Desktop.

## Cloning NLX-Try-me repository

First, let's clone the NLX project. It contains the Docker Compose file and its dependencies.

<Tabs
    groupId="operating-systems-git-clone"
    defaultValue="mac-linux"
    values={[
      { label: 'Mac & Linux', value: 'mac-linux' },
      { label: 'Windows', value: 'windows' },
    ]}
  >
  <TabItem value="mac-linux">

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx-try-me.git
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="windows">

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx-try-me.git --config core.autocrlf=input
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After the repository is cloned, move into it:

```bash
cd nlx-try-me
```

## In sum

Having prepared your environment will allow you to quickly move on during the next
chapters. Now let's [retrieve a demo certificate](./retrieve-a-demo-certificate)
so you are able to send traffic through the NLX network.
