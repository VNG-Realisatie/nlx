## Start NLX using Docker Compose

Now we have prepared all the requirements to run NLX, we can start all components using Docker Compose.

> Next to the certificates you created in [retrieve a demo certificate](./retrieve-a-demo-certificate.md) you also need certificates from an internal PKI to encrypt traffic between NLX components (such as the Management API and the Inway). The demo already has a working PKI so you don't have to set this up yourself.

First, let's clone the NLX project. It contains the Docker Compose file and its dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx-try-me.git
```

After the repository is cloned, move into it:

```bash
cd nlx-try-me
```

Set the hostname of the Inway (where `my-organization.nl:8443` should be replaced with your own hostname).

```bash
export INWAY_SELF_ADDRESS="my-organization.nl:8443"
```

Then, start all components by running:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex) (Identity Provider), PostgreSQL and the required NLX components.

The NLX components are configured using [environment variables](../reference-information/environment-variables) which in this guide are set in `docker-compose.yml`.

To be able to access NLX Management you will need to create a user with an email matching one of the users in the OpenID Connect Provider.
Since we already setup the `admin@nlx.local` user we can use this to create the admin user:

```bash
docker-compose exec api nlx-management-api create-user --email admin@nlx.local --role admin
```

At last, let's verify if all the components are up and running:

```
docker-compose ps
```

It might take a while for all components to become healthy.
If after a while one or more components aren't running you can inspect the logs for any errors.


## Dex <small>(Identity Provider)</small>

The Management UI supports the OpenID Connect protocol for authentication and authorization.
In the demo we provide Dex, which is a configurable Identity Provider.

On Linux based operating systems this works out-of-the-box.
If you're using MacOS or Windows you will need to add the hostname for Dex to the known hosts.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="mac_os"
  values={[
    { label: 'MacOS', value: 'mac_os', },
    { label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="mac_os">

```bash
sudo sh -c "echo '127.0.0.1 dex.nlx.localhost' >> /etc/hosts"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

```powershell
Add-Content -Path C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts -Value "127.0.0.1`tdex.nlx.localhost" -Force
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now let's verify that the local hostname for Dex points to the host:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="mac_os"
  values={[
    { label: 'MacOS', value: 'mac_os', },
    { label: 'Linx/Windows', value: 'linux_windows', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="linux_windows">

```bash
ping dex.nlx.localhost -4 -c 1
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mac_os">

```bash
ping dex.nlx.localhost -c 1
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The output should be:
```
PING dex.nlx.localhost (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.026 ms

--- dex.nlx.localhost ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.026/0.026/0.026/0.000 ms
```

## Access the Management UI

You can access the Management UI by opening `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
When you do you should see the login screen:

![Login screen](/img/nlx-management-login-screen.png "Login screen")

Clicking on the login button leads you to Dex which acts as an OpenID Connect Identity Provider.
For demo purposes we configured Dex to accept a static username/password but in production you would use your own Identity Provider.

You can login with the demo credentials:

- **Username**: admin@nlx.local
- **Password**: development

After logging in you will be asked to grant access.
Click on "Grant Access" to get access to the Management UI.


## Management UI overview

On the left you will find the main navigation which separates the UI in several pages:

- **Inways**: Lists all available inways.
- **Services**: Shows a list of your services. You can also register new services here.
- **Directory**: Lists all available services in the [demo directory](https://directory.demo.nlx.io/). This is also the place where you can request access to another service.
- **Settings**: Shows all global settings.

## Set the organization inway

In order to receive access requests you have to set a default inway for your organization.
You can do that by going to the settings page, selecting the "Inway-01" and clicking on "Save settings".

> In the Docker Compose file we have started, access requests can be accepted by the inway
on port `8444`. Make sure that port is publicly accessible.

## In sum

So far we have:
- Started all components using Docker Compose
- Granted access to the Management UI
- Set a default organization inway
