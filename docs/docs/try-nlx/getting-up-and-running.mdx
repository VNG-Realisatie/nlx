## Start NLX using Docker Compose

Now we have prepared all the requirements to run NLX, we can start all components using Docker Compose.

> Next to the certificates you created in [retrieve a demo certificate](./retrieve-a-demo-certificate) you also need certificates from an internal PKI to encrypt traffic between NLX components (such as the Management API and the Inway). The demo already has a working PKI so you don't have to set this up yourself.

First, let's clone the NLX project. It contains the Docker Compose file and its dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx-try-me.git
```

After the repository is cloned, move into it:

```bash
cd nlx-try-me
```

Set the hostname of the Inway (where `my-organization.nl:8443` should be replaced with your own hostname).

```bash
export INWAY_SELF_ADDRESS="my-organization.nl:8443"
```

Then, start all components by running:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start PostgreSQL and the required NLX components.

The NLX components are configured using [environment variables](../reference-information/environment-variables) which in this guide are set in `docker-compose.yml`.

Let's create a user, so we can access NLX Management:

```bash
docker-compose exec api nlx-management-api create-user --email admin@nlx.local --password=development --role admin
```

The username is `admin@nlx.local` and the password is `development`. Feel free to use the credentials you prefer.

At last, let's verify if all the components are up and running:

```
docker-compose ps
```

It might take a while for all components to become healthy.
If after a while one or more components are not running, you can inspect the logs for any errors.


## Access the Management UI

You can access the Management UI by opening `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
When you do you should see the login screen:

![Login screen](/img/nlx-management-web-interface-screenshot-basic-auth.png "Login screen for Basic Authentication")

You can login with the demo credentials:

- **Username**: admin@nlx.local
- **Password**: development

## Management UI overview

On the left you will find the main navigation which separates the UI in several pages:

- **Inways**: Lists all available inways.
- **Services**: Shows a list of your services. You can also register new services here.
- **Directory**: Lists all available services in the [demo directory](https://directory.demo.nlx.io/). This is also the place where you can request access to another service.
- **Settings**: Shows all global settings.
- **Finance**: Download financial information about the usage of your services.
- **Logs**: Lists the audit logs for your NLX installation.

## Set the organization inway

In order to receive Access Requests and send/receive Orders, you have to set a default inway for your organization.
You can do that by going to the settings page, selecting the "Inway-01" and clicking on "Save settings".

> In the Docker Compose file we have started, access requests can be accepted by the inway
on port `8444`. Make sure that port is publicly accessible.

## Transaction log

The transaction log is also included with this setup. For every request made through your outway or inway, a record is created in the transaction log.
To view the content of the transaction log run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d nlx_txlog -c "select * from transactionlog.records;"
```

## In sum

So far we have:
- Started all components using Docker Compose
- Logged in to the Management UI
- Set a default organization inway
