This Try NLX guide is made to get you started with NLX. You will learn how you can provide and consume an API's on the NLX network.  

You can either setup NLX using NLX Management, NLX Management gives you a easy-to-use interface to manage your NLX setup and you can use features like access requests. Or you could setup NLX using config files but please note that this way of configuring will be deprecated in the near future and is not recommended.

For both ways you first need to complete the following steps:

[Setup your environment](./management/introduction.md) 

[Retrieve a demo certicate](./management/introduction.md)

After completing the previous steps you can continue with:

[Setup NLX with NLX Management](./management/introduction.md) 

[Setup NLX with a config file](./config-file/provide-an-api.mdx)
