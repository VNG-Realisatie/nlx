This guide is made to get you started with NLX.
You will learn how to setup a test environment, provide and consume APIs on the NLX network.

There are two ways to set up NLX, for both you need to [set up your environment](./setup-your-environment.md):

1. **[Using NLX Management (recommended)](./management/introduction.md)**  
An easy-to-use interface to manage your NLX setup so you can use features like access requests.

1. **[Using a config.toml file](./config-file/provide-an-api.mdx)**  
Please note that this way of configuring will be deprecated in the near future and is not recommended.
