This guide is made to get you started with NLX. You will learn how to provide and consume APIs on the NLX network.  

There are two ways to set up NLX:

1. **[Using NLX Management (recommended)](./management/introduction.md)**  
An easy-to-use interface to manage your NLX setup and you can use features like access requests.

1. **[Using a config.toml file](./config-file/provide-an-api.mdx)**  
Please note that this way of configuring will be deprecated in the near future and is not recommended.

For any of these setups you first need to [set up your environment](./setup-your-environment.md)
