## This block defines a service exposed by this inway.
## A single inway can expose multiple services, therefore this block can be added multiple times.
## The name of the service (in this example PostmanEcho) must be unique for each block.
	[services.PostmanEcho]

	## `endpoint-url` should be set to the address at which the service is available.
	## In this example we simply expose the postman-echo.com website.
	endpoint-url = "https://postman-echo.com/"

	## `documentation-url` points to the documentation for provided service
	documentation-url = "https://docs.postman-echo.com/"

	# `authorization-model` can be whitelist or none (allow all)
	authorization-model = "none"

	## For testing purposes, we define a second service which exposes the postman-echo.com API.
	## But this time we add a whitelist authorization model.
	[services.PostmanEchoWhitelisted]
	endpoint-url = "https://postman-echo.com/"
	documentation-url = "https://docs.postman-echo.com/"

	## We will enable whitelist authorization for this service
	authorization-model = "whitelist"

	## `authorization-whitelist` is required when `authorization-model` is set to "whitelist".
	## This is a list of items of organizations that are allowed access. An item consists of an organization name
	## (as specified in the peers organization cert) or the a hash from the public key of their certificate.
	## WARNING: The currently deployed online NLX network is for demo purposes and not ready for connected resources containing sensitive data.
	## When using real personal data, use your own NLX network in an environment you control.
